### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ you're visiting Akshay

I'm a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science.

I am interested in Deep Learning , from training a model in Tensorflow to deploying it after Inference Optimization. Currently learning Pytorch !!
I also like Cryptography, exploring one of its application Blockchain. Trying to collab two domains.
Besides that I ocassionally compete in CP contests, though I used them to build the problem solving skills. I'm up for any kind of collaborations :rocket:
