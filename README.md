### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ you're visiting Akshay

I'm a senior CSE student at IIT Kanpur. 
I'm interested in domains of System Programming and Deep learning, particularly but not limited to Computer Vision, Adversarial AI and Explainable AI. I also have exposure to Cryptography and Blockchains. 
<br>
Besides that I ocassionally compete in CP contests, listening music and learning random stuff(mostly time). I'm up for any kind of collaborations :rocket:
